For most messages (anything except voice packages), Mumble uses Google Protobuf.

The protocol is specified in Mumble.proto. Google protoc is required to generate
the file Mumble_pb2.py, using the supplied Makefile.

A (hopefully) recent version of Mumble_pb2.py is shipped, so you shouldn't need
to do anything manually.

Otherwise, run make clean and make to create a new version of the file.
